Beneath the silver moonlit sky,
Where misty dreams and stars float by,
There gallops swift a creature rare,
With flowing mane and glittered air.

Its horn, a crystal prism bright,
Catches the hues of dawn's first light,
And where its hooves kiss earth below,
Soft blooms of magic start to grow.

In forests deep, where shadows play,
It dances wild until the day,
A whisper on the winds of night,
A fleeting glimpse of purest white.

With eyes that hold the ancient lore,
Of realms forgotten, gone before,
It weaves through time, untouched, untamed,
A spark of wonder, still unnamed.

Oh, unicorn, so fierce, so free,
You are the dream that we can't see,
A symbol of the heart’s true flight,
In endless chase of boundless light.

So when the world feels dark and worn,
Remember still, the unicorn—
For in its grace, its gentle song,
We find the place where we belong.
