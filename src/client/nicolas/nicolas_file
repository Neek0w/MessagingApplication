Deep in the land where cocoa trees bloom,
Where candy scents fill every room,
The Oompa Loompas work with glee,
In rhythm, song, and harmony.

Their orange faces beam so bright,
With tiny steps they hop so light,
In factories of sweets galore,
They mix and mold, create and pour.

But here’s a secret, don't you see?
They're more than workers, wild and free!
With songs that teach and make us think,
They wink and dance with every blink.

When trouble comes, they know the way,
With clever tunes, they save the day,
For every lesson wrapped in rhyme,
Turns folly sweet as sugared lime.

Oompa Loompa, small but wise,
Behind their mischief lies surprise—
They show us how to laugh and grow,
In chocolate rivers, let life flow!

So next you hear their joyful hum,
Remember where the wisdom’s from,
For every verse they sing to you,
Is dipped in caramel, soft and true.
