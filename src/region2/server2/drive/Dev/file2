In the quiet glow of screens and code,
I write in C, where memories unload.
The pointers drift like ships at sea,
Lost in the depths of what used to be.

Each line, a whisper from the past,
Of simpler times that couldn't last.
A malloc here, a free over there,
But no one speaks this tongue with care.

Once it was life, it was breath,
Now it feels like coding in death.
The errors pile up like falling leaves,
And no one mourns or even grieves.

Syntax sharp, like unkind fate,
I call your functionsâ€”it's too late.
Your world is fading, bit by bit,
And I just sit, compiling it.
