Beneath the surface, where code does speak,
Sockets wait in silence, sleek.
A handshake forms, a path is made,
Two worlds connect, though far away.

Packets whisper, back and forth,
From south to east, from west to north.
A silent dance of data streams,
Fulfilling distant, digital dreams.

But sometimes, mid-connection’s glow,
A timeout strikes, the speeds run slow.
Packets lost in endless flight,
Sockets sever in the night.

Still, we try, again, again,
To bridge the gap, to reach the end.
For every server, client’s plea—
A socket’s hope, to set them free.
